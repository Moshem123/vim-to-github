to-github-vim
=============

Taking you from Vim to GitHub.

```
:ToGithub
```

Will fire up the browser, opening the file and LOC of the current buffer in GitHub.

Visual mode is supported!

```
:'<,'>ToGithub
```

Installation
------------

[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) will do

```bash
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/tonchis/to-github-vim.git
```

Or just good old copy and paste.
